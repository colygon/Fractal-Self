Ensure a shallow depth of field, subtle vignette, and high contrast. Apply all changes consistently for perfect character consistency if there are multiple people.",

It is absolutely crucial to preserve their exact facial features, expressions, body proportions, and character - they must look exactly like themselves. Their skin should be dewy, sun-warmed, and glistening with water droplets, capturing every pore and droplet in hyperreal clarity. Strands of wet, tousled hair should cling to their forehead. Their eyes must catch sharp sunlight, creating tiny metallic flares. Their eyelashes should be damp and dense, casting soft shadows over their cheek. The background is a blurred blue seascape with hints of the ocean horizon. The overall color palette should feature their natural skin tone enhanced with sun-kissed warmth against an azure sea and sky. Ensure all figures are portrayed in a flattering, natural, and realistic way. This shot must have a shallow depth of field, with a tight crop on their left eye and cheek, slight lens bloom from the sun, and micro-droplets frozen mid-glint.
